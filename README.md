If you've come here from github, this is the source code for a scavenger hunt website that acts as a loose recreation of an ARG puzzle from 2020. Assets are not my own but all the code is. The source code is safe to look through due to encryption, and in fact you are encouraged to! The website is hosted at <a href="https://solalunara.github.io/0o0E">https://solalunara.github.io/0o0E</a>. The following is intended as flavour text for those who found the repository from the website rather than the other way around:

So you've made it to the source code :)

You won't find any passkeys here. The website has a fairly strict policy of announcing any and all external resources that are used for clue hunting.
You also won't find the raw files here. I presume you've looked through the source code of the website, you'll notice that the website downloads encrypted files.

What you can find is the commit history, which allows you access to the version history of the website.
If you know the passkeys, you can decrypt the previous versions of the files.

Generally the intended path to most clues have gotten easier over time, while the unintended path has gotten harder over time.
If you came here, I assume you're more intent on finding the unintended path - this repo may help you :)
